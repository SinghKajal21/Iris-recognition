# Iris-recognition
Iris recognition is a biometric technology for identifying  humans by capturing andanalyzing the unique patterns of the iris  in the human eye.
Iris recognition can beused in a wide range of applications in 
which a person’s identity must be establishedor confirmed. For 
example, these include passport control, border control, 
frequentflyer service, premises entry, access to privileged 
information, computer login or anyother transaction in which 
personal identification and authentication relies on knowl-edgebased or token-based passwords. Nevertheless, one of the most 
dangerous secu-rity threats in today’s world is impersonation, in 
which somebody claims to be some-one else. Through 
impersonation, a high-risk security area can be vulnerable. An 
un-authorized person may get access to confidential data or 
important documents can bestolen. Normally, impersonation is 
tackled by identification and secure authentication,however, the 
traditional—knowledge-based (password) or possession-based 
(ID,Smart card)—methods are not sufficient since they can be 
easily hacked orcompromised. Hence, there is an essential need 
for personal characteristics-based(biometric) identification due 
to the fact that it can provide the highest protectionagainst 
impersonation. Among other biometric approaches, the new Iris 
recognitiontechnology promises higher prospects of security.
Therefore, this research is con-ducted to further explore the 
potential of the Iris recognition technology and to demonstrate 
its potential through the development and evaluation of
a working prototype.
